# Website-Development
This website will allow users to plan a trip, collaborate with their friends/family, and write important notes during their time on the trip. Have you ever gone on a trip and forgot where you parked at the airport over a week ago? With this website you can write down that information without using up space in your camera roll or notes app! With this website you'll be able to make itineraries, include the other people on the trip, write important information, and share pictures and videos along the way! This website will be great for those who take multiple trips a year, or those who like to go back and see where they've been.
